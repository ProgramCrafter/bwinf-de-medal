It is designed for the German Jugendwettbewerb Informatik, a computer science contest with tasks using Google Blockly as a programming language-replacement.

## Running Medal

Needs `rustc` 1.28 (stable) or higher (cf. https://rustup.rs/). 

Running 
```
make
```
compiles and runs a debug-/test-server.

For production use, a release binary should be compiled and served behind a reverse proxy (nginx, apache, …). 
```
make release
```
compiles a release build with openssl statically linked for distribution.

The directories `tasks/` and `static/` can (and for throughput-purposes should) be served by the reverse proxy directly.

## Contributing

Please format your code with `rustfmt` and check it for warnings with `clippy`.

You can install those with 
```
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
rustup component add clippy
```

Format the code and check for warnings with
```
make format
make clippy
